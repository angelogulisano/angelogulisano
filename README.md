ðŸ‘‹ My name is Angelo Gulisano and I am a Microsoft MVP for Business Apps, an MCT and a Speaker.

Currently, I work as self-employed consultant and my primarily focusing is on Power Platform, SharePoint, and Microsoft 365.

I am a professional with over 15 years of experience in the IT industry. During my last job as an employee of a multinational company, I was responsible for the team that developed solutions primarily based on Power Platform and SharePoint, developing solutions in compliance with ISO9001 certification. I obtained the Agile Scrum Master certification and became an MCT. I delivered and organized courses related to the technologies used by my team.

Previously, I worked as a software developer with skills in Asp.net, SQL Server, .net Framework, and especially SharePoint, a platform that I am very passionate about and have been working with since 2007.

The experience and skills I have gained over the years allow me to provide consultancy and create customized solutions to meet the needs of my clients.

I am a curious person and passionate about problem-solving. I enjoy challenging myself with new tasks and finding creative solutions to overcome obstacles in my professional journey.
